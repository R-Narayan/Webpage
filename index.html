            <p class="disc">>ROBOWARS, the flagship event of graVITas is a one it’s kind combat robotics competition, and also one of the biggest in India and the biggest in South India. The exciting battles between the bots took place round the clock with more than 40 bots competing, in the largest and safest arena in India, to win the title and prize pool of 2.5 lakhs. Teams from around the globe competed in the weight categories of 15 kg, 30 kg and 60 kg and experienced the mayhem inside the arena. Apart from the clashing of the bots, amazing performances from the VIT Dance and the Music club enchanted the already awestruck audience.</p>

            <p class="disc"> Machine Design with Fusion 360 is a yearly workshop organized by RoboVitics in which the participants are taught how to use the Fusion 360 Software. The participants are exposed to the basics of designing, 2D sketches and drawing, 3D modelling and new features of the software like “Extrude” and “Revolve”. For this year’s workshop, participants were taught the assembly of the radial engine. After this, Motion Study Radial Engine was done. It was followed by Rendering which adds aesthetics to the designed 3D models. Simulation was also conducted which tells about how a particular object will react if its put under some certain stress or some particular condition. Lastly, they were taught about Generative Designing which, a new feature in the design industry.</p>

                    <p class="disc">As an initiative by Robovitics, we have a vision to spread our reach outside the gates of our institution. We decided to undertake a program to meet and interact with underprivileged kids from various schools and orphanages in Tamil Nadu and beyond. Every year we select a group of aspiring students from our club who are interested and capable of spreading the knowledge of robotics among young minds and making them envision the heights of innovation that can be achieved in robotics. We donate not only monetarily but also them with basic electrical and electronic components to help them know this subject better.
                      Last year, a group of Club Volunteers went to interact with children in a few local schools in Vellore. We held robotics workshops and an exhibition about our club’s projects and ideas. We extended our outreach to a school in Mumbai. Our club has been ties with Velammal Educational Trust schools in Chennai and Vellore for the past three to four years, where we visit schools and interact with students. As proud RoboVITians we aspire to not only gain knowledge but spread it to the best of our capabities.
